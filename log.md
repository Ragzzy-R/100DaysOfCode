# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 9, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Setup the initial App, setup antd, redux and other assorted library.

**Thoughts:** This time I've decided to only follow best practices. So as a first step Im gonna use debugger and no console.logs unless they are necessary.Should Also start with unit tests..
